# Hive Knowledge System + ACMM Developer Journey

## Context

Hive today targets teams at ACMM Level 3-4 — repos with CI, agents running 24/7. The goal is to make Hive useful starting from Level 1 (someone with an idea and no code), guiding them through the full developer journey to full automation. Along the way, a layered knowledge base (powered by llm-wiki) accumulates learnings, test patterns, and project-specific facts that compound over time — making agents smarter and automation safer at every level.

This design is informed by contrasting MetaSwarm (dsifry/metaswarm) with Hive. MetaSwarm's best idea — a self-improving knowledge base with automated extraction and selective priming — is adopted here. Its weakest idea — using more LLMs to verify LLM output — is replaced by Hive's existing deterministic pipeline approach, with **testing** as the primary trust mechanism instead of adversarial LLM review.

## 1. Layered Knowledge Architecture

### Implementation: geronimo-iia/llm-wiki (Rust)

Evaluated three implementations. `geronimo-iia/llm-wiki` scored 39/40 — the clear winner:
- 23 MCP tools (vs 12 and 4 for alternatives)
- First-class multi-wiki via `wiki_spaces_create` (no wrapper code needed)
- BM25 search via tantivy with confidence-weighted ranking
- Single Rust binary, zero runtime deps (just needs `git`)
- HTTP transport (shared service, not per-client stdio)
- Auto-commits on ingest, redaction support
- MIT/Apache-2.0 licensed — can fork if needed
- Risk: single maintainer, 1 month old. Mitigated by license + pure Rust.

### Four wiki layers, merged at prime time

Knowledge flows DOWN automatically (community → personal). Knowledge flows UP only with explicit opt-in.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Community Wiki          PUBLIC / READ-ONLY      │
│  Hosted centrally (e.g., wiki.hive.dev)          │
│  CNCF patterns, Go/React best practices          │
│  Anyone can read, curated contributors write      │
│  "Go operators need envtest"                      │
│  "Helm charts need values.schema.json"            │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                   │ MCP query (HTTP, cross-wiki)
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────────┐
│  Org Wiki                SHARED / TEAM-SCOPED    │
│  Hosted per-org (e.g., wiki.kubestellar.io)      │
│  Or git-backed repo (kubestellar/hive-wiki)      │
│  Org members read+write, outsiders read-only     │
│  "ALWAYS use DCO signing"                        │
│  "isDemoData wiring is MANDATORY"                │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                   │ MCP query (HTTP or local)
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────────┐
│  Project Wiki            SHARED / REPO-SCOPED    │
│  Lives in .hive/wiki/ inside the repo            │
│  Same access as the repo itself                  │
│  "vite.config.ts TS errors are IDE noise"        │
│  "createMockCluster() lives in test/factory"     │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                   │ MCP query (local)
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────────┐
│  Personal Wiki           PRIVATE / LOCAL-ONLY    │
│  Lives on YOUR machine (~/.hive/wiki/)           │
│  Your preferences, corrections, style            │
│  NEVER leaves your machine. NEVER shared.        │
│  Highest precedence — overrides all layers above │
│  "I prefer single bundled PRs"                   │
│  "Don't summarize at the end of responses"       │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                   │ all layers merged + filtered
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────────┐
│  knowledge-primer.sh (pipeline stage)            │
│  Deterministic: queries MCP by file paths,       │
│  filters by relevance, injects into work         │
│  order sent to agent                             │
│  Precedence: personal > project > org > community│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Hosting model

| Layer | Where it lives | Who can read | Who can write | Hosting |
|-------|---------------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| **Personal** | `~/.hive/wiki/` on user's machine | Only you | Only you | Local llm-wiki instance (never networked) |
| **Project** | `.hive/wiki/` in repo | Anyone with repo access | Agents + Knowledge Curator | Local llm-wiki instance per worktree |
| **Org** | Dedicated git repo (e.g., `kubestellar/hive-wiki`) | Org members | Promoted facts from project wikis | llm-wiki HTTP service (self-hosted or cloud) |
| **Community** | Public git repo or hosted service | Anyone | Curated contributors (PR-based) | llm-wiki HTTP service at wiki.hive.dev |

### Privacy principles

1. **Personal wiki never syncs** — it stays on your machine, period. No telemetry, no upload, no "anonymous aggregation."
2. **Project wiki inherits repo visibility** — private repo = private wiki. Public repo = public wiki.
3. **Promotion is always explicit** — facts flow up (personal → project → org → community) only when a human or agent explicitly promotes them.
4. **Down-flow is automatic** — community/org/project knowledge primes your agents automatically. You don't have to opt in to receive collective knowledge.
5. **Personal always wins** — if your personal wiki says "use tabs" and the org wiki says "use spaces," your agents use tabs.

### Promotion flow

```
Personal fact
  → user runs: hive promote --to project "this is useful for the team"
    → fact appears in .hive/wiki/ with provenance: "promoted from personal by <user>"

Project fact (seen in 3+ repos across org)
  → knowledge curator proposes promotion
    → org maintainer approves (or auto-promote if confidence > 0.9)
      → fact appears in org wiki

Org fact (universal best practice)
  → maintainer opens PR to community wiki repo
    → community reviewers approve
      → fact available to all Hive users
```

### Why llm-wiki over raw JSONL (MetaSwarm's approach)

| Capability | MetaSwarm JSONL | llm-wiki |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Cross-referencing | Manual tags | `[[wikilinks]]` with backlinks |
| Querying | `grep -i` on files | MCP semantic query ("gotchas for CardWrapper.tsx?") |
| Staleness detection | Weekly cron by curator agent | Built-in `lint` finds contradictions, orphans, stale claims |
| Multi-format | JSON only | HTML (humans), JSON-LD (structured), .txt (LLM context) |
| Version control | Flat files in repo | Git-backed with merge/diff/blame |
| Dashboard integration | None | HTML export renderable in Hive dashboard |

### Knowledge types stored

| Type | Example | Primed When |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Pattern** | "Use mock factories from `test/factories.ts`" | Agent touches test files |
| **Gotcha** | "`.join()` on undefined crashes — guard with `(arr \|\| [])`.join()" | Agent edits hook consumers |
| **Decision** | "State management uses Zustand + TanStack Query" | Agent adds new state |
| **Regression** | "PR #1281: `.join()` on undefined — test in `useSearchIndex.test.ts`" | Agent edits `useSearchIndex.ts` |
| **Test scaffold** | "This project uses vitest + msw + testing-library" | Agent creates any test file |
| **Integration** | "envtest needs 30s timeout on CI, 10s locally" | Agent modifies controller tests |
| **Coverage rule** | "Cards using `useCached*` MUST have isDemoData test cases" | Agent creates a new card |

## 2. ACMM Developer Journey

Hive guides (not does) the work at lower levels, progressively increasing autonomy as the project matures.

### Level 1 — Idea (No repo, no code)

**What Hive does**: Guides the user through project scaffolding.

- User describes what they want to build
- Hive queries **community wiki** for scaffolding patterns, CI templates, project structure
- Guides user through: repo creation → initial structure → first commit → basic CI
- **Testing starts here**: Hive guides user to write acceptance criteria as test stubs
  - `test("should reconcile CRD when namespace is created")` with `TODO` body
  - These define the contract — what "done" looks like — before any production code
  - 0% coverage, 100% intent
- **Knowledge**: Community patterns only (no project-specific facts yet)
- **Agents**: None running. Hive is interactive/advisory.

### Level 2 — Development (Code exists, PRs are manual)

**What Hive does**: Acts as reviewer/advisor, not autonomous.

- Hive reviews PRs on request (not auto-scanning)
- Flags PRs that add code without tests: "this handler has no test — want me to suggest one?"
- **Testing**: Tests alongside features, no hard gate
  - Coverage trending up (tracked, not enforced)
  - Test stubs from Level 1 get filled in as features land
  - Community wiki primes test patterns: "Go operators need envtest", "React: use msw for API mocking"
- **Knowledge accumulation begins**:
  - Knowledge Curator watches merged PRs, extracts gotchas and patterns
  - **Project wiki** starts: "this repo uses controller-runtime v2", "webhook tests need envtest"
  - User corrections ("no, we use X not Y") become high-confidence facts
- **Agents**: Scanner in advisory mode (suggests, doesn't act). No governor.

### Level 3 — CI/CD (Automated builds, tests running)

**What Hive does**: Scanner and reviewer active, governor in QUIET/IDLE mode.

- Scanner triages issues, creates fix PRs for simple bugs
- Reviewer monitors CI health, nightly tests, coverage trends
- **Testing becomes a gate**:
  - Coverage thresholds enforced in CI (configurable, e.g., 70% lines)
  - Thresholds ratchet up as project matures (never down)
  - Scanner auto-creates issues when coverage drops below threshold
  - Nightly integration tests catch service drift
- **Knowledge is now rich**:
  - Org wiki contributes cross-repo patterns: "all kubestellar repos need Netlify preview deploys"
  - Project wiki has dozens of facts from merged PRs
  - Regression patterns accumulate: "changing webhook port breaks envtest — update `testenv.Environment.WebhookInstallOptions`"
- **Agents**: Scanner + reviewer. Governor in QUIET/IDLE. Architect opportunistic.

### Level 4 — Full Automation (5 agents, 24/7, self-healing)

**What Hive does**: Governor scales dynamically, all agents active.

- Full Hive deployment: scanner, reviewer, architect, outreach, supervisor
- Governor adjusts cadences and models by queue depth (SURGE/BUSY/QUIET/IDLE)
- **Testing is what makes autonomy safe**:
  - Full TDD: every bug fix reproduces the bug in a test first (red), then fixes (green)
  - `merge-gate.sh` requires green CI — deterministic, not LLM-verified
  - Regression tests accumulate automatically from every bug fix
  - Coverage thresholds are high and enforced (e.g., 90%+ lines)
  - **The test suite is the trust mechanism** — not "an LLM reviewed another LLM's code"
- **Knowledge compounds**:
  - All three wiki layers active, merged at prime time
  - Knowledge Curator extracts from every merged PR across all repos
  - Lessons from this project feed back into org layer (and optionally community)
  - Agents get smarter without any human intervention
- **Agents**: All 5. Governor active. Auto-deploy. Dashboard monitoring.

## 3. Testing Progression Detail

| Level | Test Approach | Coverage Gate | Who Writes Tests | Trust Model |
|-------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **1 — Idea** | Acceptance criteria as test stubs (`TODO` bodies) | None | User (guided by Hive) | Human judgment |
| **2 — Dev** | Tests alongside features, no hard gate | Tracked, not enforced | User + Hive suggests | Human review + test results |
| **3 — CI/CD** | Coverage threshold in CI, nightly integration | 70%+ (ratcheting) | User + scanner fixes include tests | CI pass = trust |
| **4 — Full Auto** | Full TDD, regression on every bug fix | 90%+ enforced | Agents (scanner, architect) | Green test suite = trust |

### The feedback loop

```
Bug found
  → Test written to reproduce (red)
    → Fix applied (green)
      → Knowledge Curator extracts pattern
        → Wiki updated: "guard .join() against undefined in hook consumers"
          → Next agent touching that area gets primed with the gotcha
            → Writes the guard AND the test proactively
```

### Test knowledge in the wiki

The wiki stores test patterns alongside code patterns:

- **Test scaffolding**: "This project uses vitest + msw + testing-library" → primed when agent creates any test file
- **Mock patterns**: "Use `createMockCluster()` from `test/factories.ts`, not inline mocks" → primed when agent touches test files
- **Regression markers**: "PR #1281 crashed because `.join()` on undefined — regression test in `useSearchIndex.test.ts`" → primed when agent edits `useSearchIndex.ts`
- **Integration gotchas**: "envtest needs 30s timeout on CI, 10s locally" → primed when agent modifies controller tests
- **Coverage rules**: "Cards using `useCached*` hooks MUST have isDemoData test cases" → primed when agent creates a new card component

### Adaptive test strictness

Just as the governor adapts model selection by queue depth, it adapts test requirements by project maturity:

```
ACMM Level 1-2: testMode = "suggest"
  → Hive suggests tests, doesn't block without them

ACMM Level 3:   testMode = "gate"
  → CI blocks merges below coverage threshold
  → Scanner creates issues for coverage drops

ACMM Level 4:   testMode = "tdd"
  → Agents must write failing test before fix (red-green)
  → Merge gate requires green suite + coverage threshold
  → Regression test required for every bug fix
```

## 4. v2 Architecture Integration

Hive v2 is a Go binary with structured packages under `v2/pkg/`. The knowledge system adds a new `pkg/knowledge/` package and extends existing packages.

### New package: `v2/pkg/knowledge/`

```
v2/pkg/knowledge/
  client.go          — llm-wiki MCP HTTP client (query, search, ingest, lint, spaces)
  primer.go          — Selective fact retrieval by file paths, keywords, work type
  curator.go         — Extract facts from merged PRs, ingest into wiki
  promote.go         — Promote facts between layers (project→org, etc.)
  types.go           — Fact, Layer, WikiConfig, ConfidenceScore, Precedence types
  client_test.go
  primer_test.go
  curator_test.go
  promote_test.go
```

### How it integrates with existing v2 packages

| v2 Package | Integration |
|------------|-------------|
| `pkg/config/` | Add `Knowledge` section to `hive.yaml` (layers, wiki paths, curator schedule, primer config) |
| `pkg/snapshot/` | Add `Knowledge []Fact` field to snapshot state — primed facts per work item |
| `pkg/classify/` | After classification, call `knowledge.Primer.Prime(item)` to enrich with relevant facts |
| `pkg/governor/` | Add test maturity level to governor decisions; adapt agent directives by ACMM level |
| `pkg/scheduler/` | Add curator schedule (daily or on-merge trigger) |
| `pkg/dashboard/` | Add `/api/knowledge/*` endpoints proxying to llm-wiki MCP; Knowledge tab in frontend |
| `pkg/agent/` | Include primed facts in agent work orders |

### Pipeline flow (v2)

In v2, the pipeline is Go code, not shell scripts:

```
snapshot.Build()
  → classify.Classify(items)          // existing: complexity tier, lane, model rec
    → knowledge.Prime(items, layers)  // NEW: query wiki by file paths, merge layers
      → scheduler.Dispatch(items)     // existing: send to agents with enriched snapshot
```

The primer runs deterministically — Go HTTP client queries llm-wiki, filters by file paths, no LLM in the loop.

### Curator flow (separate goroutine)

```
scheduler.RunCurator(schedule)
  → github.FetchMergedPRs(since)     // existing GitHub client
    → knowledge.Extract(prs)          // NEW: parse diffs, review comments, CI results
      → knowledge.Ingest(facts, wiki) // NEW: call llm-wiki MCP ingest endpoint
```

The curator uses an LLM (via llm-wiki's synthesis layer) for knowledge extraction only — not for enforcement or gating.

### Config (hive.yaml)

```yaml
knowledge:
  enabled: true
  engine: "llm-wiki"  # geronimo-iia/llm-wiki (Rust)
  layers:
    - type: personal
      path: "~/.hive/wiki"
      shared: false          # NEVER syncs, NEVER leaves machine
      precedence: 1          # highest — overrides all others
    - type: project
      path: ".hive/wiki"
      shared: true           # inherits repo visibility
      precedence: 2
    - type: org
      url: "https://wiki.kubestellar.io/mcp"  # or local git repo
      shared: true
      precedence: 3
    - type: community
      url: "https://wiki.hive.dev/mcp"         # public, read-only
      shared: true
      precedence: 4          # lowest — overridden by all others
  curator:
    schedule: "daily"
    extract_from: ["pr_comments", "ci_failures", "review_comments"]
    auto_promote_threshold: 0.9  # confidence to auto-promote project→org
  primer:
    max_facts: 25
    priority: ["regression", "gotcha", "test_scaffold", "pattern", "decision"]
    merge_strategy: "precedence"  # personal > project > org > community
```

---

## 5. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: llm-wiki integration (project-level only)

**Files to create/modify in `v2/`**:

1. **`v2/pkg/knowledge/types.go`** — Core types
   - `Fact`, `Layer`, `LayerType`, `WikiConfig`, `ConfidenceScore`
   - `PrimerConfig`, `CuratorConfig`, `PromoteRequest`

2. **`v2/pkg/knowledge/client.go`** — llm-wiki MCP HTTP client
   - `Search(query, filters)`, `Read(slug)`, `Ingest(facts)`, `Lint()`, `Stats()`
   - `SpacesList()`, `SpacesCreate(name, path)`
   - Connects to llm-wiki HTTP endpoint (configurable per layer)
   - Falls back gracefully if wiki unavailable

3. **`v2/pkg/knowledge/primer.go`** — Selective fact priming
   - `Prime(items []WorkItem, layers []Layer) []EnrichedItem`
   - Queries each layer by file paths, keywords, work type
   - Merges results with precedence (personal > project > org > community)
   - Filters to top N facts by priority order

4. **`v2/pkg/knowledge/curator.go`** — Knowledge extraction
   - `Extract(prs []PullRequest) []Fact`
   - `Ingest(facts []Fact, targetLayer Layer)`
   - Parses PR diffs, review comments, CI failures
   - Calls llm-wiki `wiki_ingest` to add facts

5. **`v2/pkg/config/`** — Add `Knowledge` field to config struct, parse from `hive.yaml`

6. **`v2/pkg/snapshot/state.go`** — Add `Knowledge []Fact` to snapshot state

7. **`v2/pkg/dashboard/server.go`** — Add knowledge API endpoints (proxying to llm-wiki MCP)

8. **Tests** — `client_test.go`, `primer_test.go`, `curator_test.go` with mock llm-wiki server

### Phase 2: Testing progression engine

9. **`v2/pkg/knowledge/maturity.go`** — ACMM test maturity detector
   - `DetectMaturity(repo) Level` — checks: has tests? has CI? coverage config? TDD markers?
   - Returns Level 1-4

10. **`v2/pkg/governor/governor.go`** — Add test maturity to governor logic
    - Governor reads maturity level from snapshot
    - Adjusts agent directives: suggest (L1-2) → gate (L3) → tdd (L4)

11. **`v2/policies/`** — Template variables for test mode per maturity level

### Phase 3: Org and community layers

12. **`v2/pkg/knowledge/promote.go`** — Fact promotion between layers
    - `Promote(fact, fromLayer, toLayer)` — copies with provenance
    - Auto-promote when confidence > threshold AND seen in 3+ repos

13. **Org wiki deployment** — Docker Compose service or standalone llm-wiki HTTP instance

14. **Community wiki** — Hosted service (future, separate infrastructure)

### Phase 4: Dashboard Knowledge UI

The Hive dashboard gets a new **Knowledge tab** — the primary UI for users to browse, search, and manage their wikis.

GET  /api/knowledge                    # List facts across layers (paginated, filterable)
GET  /api/knowledge/:layer             # List facts in specific layer
GET  /api/knowledge/:layer/:slug       # Read single fact with metadata
GET  /api/knowledge/search?q=&type=    # BM25 search across subscribed layers
GET  /api/knowledge/graph?root=&depth= # Wikilink graph (Mermaid/JSON)
GET  /api/knowledge/health             # Stale/orphan/contradiction counts
GET  /api/knowledge/stats              # Aggregate stats (counts by type, layer, confidence)
POST /api/knowledge/promote            # Promote fact to higher layer
POST /api/knowledge/archive            # Archive a fact
POST /api/knowledge/override           # Create personal override of a fact
GET  /api/knowledge/subscriptions      # List subscribed wiki endpoints
POST /api/knowledge/subscriptions      # Add/remove subscription
```

All endpoints proxy to llm-wiki MCP tools. Dashboard auth (bearer token) applies to mutations.

## 6. Verification

### Phase 1 verification
- Set up llm-wiki MCP server locally against a test project
- Run `knowledge-primer.sh` and confirm it produces enriched `actionable.json` with relevant facts
- Run `knowledge-curator.sh` against recent merged PRs and confirm facts are extracted and ingested
- Verify pipeline runs end-to-end: enumerate → classify → prime → kick
- Verify agents receive knowledge in their work orders

### Phase 2 verification
- Create test projects at each maturity level (1-4)
- Run `test-maturity.sh` and confirm correct level detection
- Verify governor adjusts test directives by level
- Verify scanner behavior changes: suggests (L2) vs gates (L3) vs TDD (L4)

### Phase 3 verification
- Stand up org wiki, push facts from project curator
- Verify `knowledge-primer.sh` merges layers correctly (personal > project > org > community)
- Verify org-level facts appear in agent work orders
- Verify personal overrides take precedence in merged results

### Phase 4 verification
- Dashboard Knowledge tab renders with all four layers
- Search returns results across layers with correct precedence
- Fact detail view shows provenance, wikilinks, usage stats
- Promote/Archive/Override actions work end-to-end
- Graph view renders wikilink connections across layers
- Health panel shows stale/orphan/contradiction counts from `wiki_lint`
- Subscription management adds/removes wiki endpoints

## 7. Resolved Decisions

1. **llm-wiki implementation** — `geronimo-iia/llm-wiki` (Rust). 39/40 score. First-class multi-wiki, BM25 search, git-backed, HTTP transport. Single binary, zero deps.
2. **Knowledge layers** — Four layers (personal/project/org/community), not three. Personal wiki is private, local-only, highest precedence.
3. **Privacy model** — Down-flow automatic, up-flow explicit. Personal never shared. Project inherits repo visibility.

## 8. Open Questions

1. **Rust 1.95 requirement** — Our machine has 1.87. Need to install via rustup or use Homebrew nightly. Or use the prebuilt binary / Homebrew tap (`brew install geronimo-iia/tap/llm-wiki`).
2. **Community wiki seeding** — What initial content? CNCF TAG guidelines? Extracted from top 100 CNCF project READMEs? Start empty and let it grow?
3. **Knowledge curation approval** — Auto-extracted facts go to project wiki at confidence < 0.9. Auto-promote to org wiki at confidence >= 0.9. Human approval for community wiki (PR-based).
4. **Cross-project fact promotion** — Automatic when seen in 3+ repos AND confidence > 0.9. Otherwise manual.
5. **Personal wiki bootstrapping** — Should `hive init` create a personal wiki from Claude Code's existing memory files? (e.g., migrate `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/` → `~/.hive/wiki/`)
